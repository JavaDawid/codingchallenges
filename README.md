#### DEPENDENCIES ####

- JUnit Jupiter (org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.9.2) for testing.


#### TESTING ####

All my algorithms code has tests. JUnit was used to write tests 


#### RUNNING TESTS ####

To run the tests for the recruitment algorithms, you should have a development environment set up with JUnit support. Below are the general steps to run the tests:

1. **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JavaDawid/codingchallenges
   
2. **Ensure JUnit is Configured:** Make sure that JUnit Jupiter is properly configured in your project. If it's not, you can add it as a dependency to your project build file (e.g., pom.xml for Maven). You can find the dependency information in the **"DEPENDENCIES"** section of this README.

3. **Run the Tests:** Navigate to the test packet <b><i>leetcode</i></b>. Right-click on the test class file and select "Run".
