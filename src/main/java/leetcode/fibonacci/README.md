# FIBONACCI #

This project contains a simple implementation of a Fibonacci Sequence Generator in Java, along with its corresponding unit tests using the JUnit 5 framework.

 #### **DESCRIPTION** ####
 
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.
The **Fibonacci** class in this project contains a method ***fib(int n)*** witch return the **n** number in Fibonacci sequence.

#### **USAGE** ####

Here is a simple example how use the **Fibonacci** class
    
    Fibonacci fibonacci = new Fibonacci();
    int result = fibonacci.fib(5);  // result will be 5

#### **TESTING** ####
