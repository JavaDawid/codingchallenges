# RECRUTIMENT ALGORITHMS #

#### DESCRIPTION ####
In repository **scr/test/java/leetcode** you can find a set of task and algorithms that you can get at recruitment meeting. In each package with task you find class with solution and test class.


- anagram242 
  This package contains a simple Java program **Valid Anagram** for checking if two words are anagrams. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


- fibonacci
The **Fibonacci Sequence** is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.


- firstUniqeCharacter387 
 **First Unique Character** find the first non-repeating character in input string.


- fizzBuzz412
**Fizz Buzz** return FizzBuzz, Fizz, Buzz for numbers divided by 3 and 5, divided only by 3 and only by 5.


- increase

multiplies two integers without multiplies sign.


- largeelement
Given an array of integers, task of program is to finds the second-largest element present in the array.


- longestCommonPrefix
**Longest Common Prefix** find the longest common prefix from an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return the empty string "".


- palindrome9
**Palindrome** it take an integer x and return x if is a palindrome and return false in otherwise. Palindrome it is a number or word that read from both ways, has the same meaning.


- reverseString
**Reverse String** it take an char array and return reversed array.


- sortcharacter451
**Sort Characters By Frequency** sorts the letters in input string by frequency in the decreasing order. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.


- two/sum1
that program take it array of integers and target integer. From array it select two numbers to add together will return target and return array index of that numbers. 

- validParentheses20
given a string "s" containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']', determine if the input string is valid. Open brackets mus be closed by the same type of brackets and closed in the correct order.


#### DEPENDENCIES ####

- JUnit Jupiter (org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.9.2) for testing.
